# SonosRemote
A Sonos remote for the Lilygo T Dsiplay S3. 

NOTE: it actually manages the remote using HomeAssistant endpoints in my environment. 
Will need extensive mods to work for you, but inlcuding as examples of grabbing and displaying album art.

Uses stock hardware. My initial goal was a small, battery powered dedicated display/remote that I could use in the backyard without having to pull out the phone. But I'm finding it's more valuable on the desk in my office where it is useful as a mute/next-track device.
